    "* __Jupyter Notebook__:  \n",
    "You are currently in a Jupyter notebook. This is an exploratory environment where you can un many different types of code, see the results, and interact them. Each of the 4 labs in this workshop is a single notebook. These notebooks are accessible through the table of contents at the top of any lab.\n",

    "* Chrome is recommended but any modern browser should work\n",
    "* Poor network connectivity may cause minor delays when navigating the notebook.\n",
    "* When a cell is running you will see the text to the left change to `In [*]:`.\n",
    "* When a cell's code has finished you will see the text to the left change to `In [19]:`. \n",

    "* **Finally** - You're free to experiment and rerun cells. \n",
    "    * Nothing should break if cells are run more than once or out of order or rerun."
